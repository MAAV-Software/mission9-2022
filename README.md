# MAAV Mission 9 Repo - 2022
Welcome to the MAAV repo!



## Introduction
This README document is a work-in-progress. We will populate this more later.

## Install and Simulator Setup Instructions

Let MAAV Software Leadership know if you run into issues during any of the setup.

[Windows / Mac (Intel)](docs/VBox.md)

[Mac (M1)](docs/Mac.md)

[Ubuntu / Other Linux Distro (TODO)](docs/Linux.md)


## Development Etiquette

This section will go over our team's expectations with using Git/Github.
We will also provide a summary of common Git operations in case you are
new to using Git with software projects. If you need help with Git/Github,
reach out to the team in Slack.

When in doubt, [check out "Oh Shit! Git!"](https://ohshitgit.com)

### Git Identity

Make sure your identity through Git is setup well.

```bash
# List current global config, which may contain identity info

$ git config --global -l
user.name=Drew Scheffer
user.email=drewskis@umich.edu
core.editor=vim
...

# Set or Change some things (for any repository you use)
# Omit --global to just make it for THIS repository

$ git config --global user.name "Drew Scheffer"
$ git config --global user.email "drewskis@umich.edu"
```

### Git Branches

When developing a new feature, bug fix, or set of changes, make a new branch.
This will allow your `master` branch to stay clean and organized in terms of
commit history and file changes. If you are added to the MAAV-Software organization,
it will also allow you to push changes to this project and make pull requests
without needing to fork the repository. \
Please name your branch in the format `uniqname/branch_name` (e.g. drewskis/my_branch)

This project's `master` branch is protected, and only Software Leadership can merge
in changes from other branches or forks (more on forks later).

```bash
# List branches
$ git branch

# Create a new branch
$ git checkout -b <branch>

# Switch to a branch
$ git checkout <branch>

# Delete a branch (will warn you if branch is not fully merged into master)
$ git branch -d <branch>
```

### Git Repository Fork

Simple GitHub Forking Tutorial:

https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

Forking repositories is a straightforward approach to making changes to shared repositories.
'Forked' repositories are personal copies of a shared project, in which you can make changes
and then offer those changes up to the original project.

If you are officially a member of MAAV Software, forking the repo is optional. However, forking
gives you access control over your pushed changes - whereas anyone else on MAAV Software
can view and make changes to *any* branch that is not `master`.

## Simulating the Vehicle

We will be using Gazebo to simulate vehicle behavior. This is done within a virtual environment to ensure dependencies are setup correctly in our code.
Gazebo is already installed for you if you follow the install instructions for
your system.
